# AdaOS x86-64

This repository is to report major issues and download AdaOS

AdaOS (Ada Operating System) is a GNU/LINUX operating system based on Rocky Linux which focuses on user experience, design, freedom, privacy and stability.

**DEVELOPMENT BOARD**
*Incomplete*

Currently under development -
Completed features:
- ROPM (https://github.com/2048hertz/ropm)

Semi-completed features:
- Desktop (https://github.com/2048hertz/ece)
- Raspberry Pi 5 / ARM version (From my archived AstraOS project)
- Update Manager (https://github.com/Mrsupertag/adaupdatemanager)
- Flet install script (https://github.com/Mrsupertag/adaos-flet)
- Help Application (https://github.com/Mrsupertag/adaos-help)

Important things to be completed:
- Addition of a custom kernel
- App store
- Installer ISO

Things that may be added:
- Optional AI -- Can be disabled for performance (would be called either RobertAI or Ada-AI) (likely will not be there because we don't want to invade people's privacy nor hinder their computer speed)
- Space -- An app that can be turned on by the press of a keybind, it acts as a place for one to collect their thoughts, everything will be stored locally so no data will be managed by us. This app is basically a glorified notes app so we'd rather just install a normal one by default I guess.

The name "Ada" came from Ada Lovelace, the world's first computer programmer.

**Being actively developed in Dhaka, Bangladesh**

This operating system is built to give a stable linux experience to whoever wants it, and to appease to the Bangladeshi Linux community
